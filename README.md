Perfect 👌 Your README is already structured really well. Since you want it **clean, beginner-friendly, and tailored to your Stablecoin project**, I’ll refine what you wrote, add clarity to the project structure (since you have `StableCoin.sol` and `DepositCoin.sol`), and make the instructions slightly more polished.

Here’s the improved version:

# 🪙 Stablecoin Project

A simple **ERC20-based Stablecoin** implementation in Solidity.
This project demonstrates how to **build, deploy, and test a stablecoin** using **Foundry (Anvil, Forge, Cast)**.

---

## 📌 Features

* ✅ **ERC20-compatible** token with customizable name, symbol, and decimals.
* ✅ Includes **StableCoin.sol** and **DepositCoin.sol** for experimenting with different token behaviors.
* ✅ Built with **Solidity 0.8.x** (with built-in overflow/underflow protection).
* ✅ Uses **Foundry scripts** for easy deployment (`Script.sol`).
* ✅ Well-commented and beginner-friendly code.
* ✅ Comes with unit tests to validate ERC20 behavior.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stablecoin.git
   cd stablecoin
   ```

2. **Install Foundry** (if not already installed)

   ```bash
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   foundryup
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   forge install
   ```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1️⃣ Run Local Blockchain

Start a local blockchain using **Anvil**:

```bash
anvil
```

### 2️⃣ Deploy Stablecoin

Run the deployment script:

```bash
forge script script/ERC20Script.sol \
  --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 \
  --broadcast \
  --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

### 3️⃣ Run Tests

Run the included unit tests:

```bash
forge test
```

---

## 🧪 Example

When deployed, the Stablecoin contract will create a new ERC20 token with:

* Name: **Name**
* Symbol: **SYM**
* Decimals: **18**

You can then:

* Transfer tokens between accounts
* Approve and spend tokens via `transferFrom`
* Interact with additional contracts (`StableCoin.sol`, `DepositCoin.sol`)

---

## 📖 Learning Goals

This project is designed to teach beginners:

* How to implement **ERC20 tokens** from scratch.
* How to use **custom scripts** for deployment with Foundry.
* How to write and run **tests with Forge**.
* How to manage **environment variables** like `PRIVATE_KEY` in scripts.
* How to extend ERC20 with different logic (Stablecoin, deposit-based token, etc.).

⚡ Question for you:
Do you want me to also add a **step-by-step testing guide with real `forge test` output logs** (like showing `[PASS] testTransferTokenCorrectly()` etc.), so beginners see exactly what to expect when running tests?
